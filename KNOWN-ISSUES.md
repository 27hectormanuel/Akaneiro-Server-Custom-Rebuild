# Known issues and limitations

The server is complete enough to play the whole game, but a few things are different from the
original. They fall into three groups: behaviour of the game client that a server cannot change,
features of the original online service that are not built, and rules the original server had
that are lost and were rebuilt by assumption.

## Client behaviour (cannot be fixed on the server)

The game client is used as it is, so these stay:

- **Missions on "Low" end after their first task.** That is the original mission data: on Low
  every mission has a single task, the full story with its boss starts on Medium. (Recordings of
  the original game show the same.) The stone gate to the boss in A2_M2, for example, only opens
  in a Medium task.
- **"Task complete: Unkonw Task"** (sic) appears after some tasks. The server sends the correct
  branch and task ids; the client looks the name up in its own mission data and does not find it
  there. Its data also calls every step of "Raging Ushi Oni" "Wicked Beasts".
- **Quick slots** only point to the bag slot: an item put on the quick bar still occupies its bag
  slot.
- **Mission timer, minimap, the shimmer on switches and the hand/kunai mouse cursor** are drawn by
  the client and behave as it decides.
- **Crafting materials show a value of 0** in their tooltip: the client only computes values for
  equipment. Selling them still pays (a fifth of their shop price each).
- **The "speed up" panel of the mission cooldown** does not send anything to the server. That is
  why mission cooldowns are switched off (see below).
- **Thrown balls start at the monster's centre**, not in its hand (the client's projectile code).
- **The crystal shop opens in the Steam overlay** when the client wants crystals, for example when
  karma is short for a training. That page does not exist anymore, so the overlay shows an error
  page; close it. Crystal prices are free on this server, karma prices are not.
- **The client asks for the "friend reward" twice** every time a map loads. The server answers
  only once per visit, otherwise the mission summary screen would close right after opening.

## Not built: the original online features

*Akaneiro* had no real-time co-op: the network protocol has no messages for other players in the
same level. Its online side was social and asynchronous, and none of it exists on this server yet:

- **Summoning friends as allies.** In the original you could take a friend's character along as an
  AI-controlled ally, and you earned rewards when friends hired yours. The client still has the
  summon button; its friend list stays empty here.
- **Chat with other players.** Messages are only echoed back to the sender. Since several players
  can be connected to one server, this one could be added.
- **Leaderboards, events, mail, gift and redeem codes.** The mailbox is always empty, codes are
  never valid, event reports are accepted and ignored.
- **Buying crystals with real money.** Not possible; instead, everything that costs crystals is
  free (revivals, stash tabs, crystal items, spirit rentals priced in crystals, finishing
  trainings early, crafting with crystals).
- **Well upgrades** were bought with crystals and are not offered by this client: the well stays
  on level 1 (100 karma every 15 minutes).
- **Steam login checks.** The server does not verify Steam tickets or DLC ownership; every login
  is accepted. Fine on your own PC or LAN, unsafe on the open internet (see [HOSTING.md](HOSTING.md)).

Several players can use one server at the same time, but each plays in their own world and they
never meet.

## Approximations

- **Monster pathfinding.** The level files contain no navigation mesh (the client computes it from
  the level geometry when it loads). The server learns where the ground is walkable from the
  player's own trail, spawn points and wander routes, and monsters follow those ways around
  obstacles. In an area the player has not walked yet, a monster may take a straighter line than
  the client would.
- **Abilities only damage monsters.** Baskets, chests and switches break from normal attacks.
- **A spirit helper that levels up** during a mission shows its new level the next time the spirit
  list is opened.

## Assumptions (original formulas lost)

The original server code is lost. Where the client's data does not say how something works, the
server uses these rules. They are the first place to look when something feels off balance.

- **Experience:** monsters give 4 times the experience in their prefab.
- **Kill chains:** GOOD from 3 kills, LETHAL from 6, SLAYER from 10, paying 50 / 75 / 100 % of
  the chain's experience as a bonus (matches recordings: 3 wolves +18 XP, 6 wolves +54 XP). A chain
  ends 3 seconds after the last kill.
- **Threat levels:** beating a threat level unlocks the next one of the same map.
- **Mission cooldowns** are switched off: maps can be replayed at once. The original rules
  (the n-th run within a day rests for the n-th entry of `MissionsThreatCycle`) are implemented in
  `MissionMap` and can be switched on with `CooldownsEnabled`.
- **Vendor prices:** buying costs item level × base value (2.5 times what selling pays); the rare
  vendor's items are 2 levels higher and cost twice as much; 16 + 4 offers, replaced every 12 hours.
  Selling equipment pays exactly the tooltip value; stackables sell for a fifth of their shop price.
- **Armor:** armor = the worn pieces (as their tooltips show) + 5 per point of DEF; it takes away
  armor / (armor + 2000) of a monster's hit (constants from the client's `GameConfig.xml`), at most
  75 %. On level 1 that is below 10 %.
- **Talents:** one point per level from level 2; the discipline picked at creation counts as one
  more. Per point: Prowess 30/10/20, Fortitude 20/30/10, Cunning 10/20/30 POW/DEF/SKILL (from the
  client).
- **Starting masteries:** the two the character creation screen shows for the discipline, on level 1.
- **Character numbers:** critical chance 5 % + 0.025 % per SKILL point, critical hits do 135 %,
  +0.2 % damage per POW point. Gems, enchantments, elements, masteries, food and spirits work as
  their descriptions say. Food without a number in its text: "small boost" +25 % (speed and crit
  +10, experience +25 %), "more than doubles" +110 %, regeneration +50 % / +100 %. Health does not
  regenerate on its own (only through potions, food, spirits and the Heavy Armor mastery); energy
  refills in about 25 seconds.
- **Crafting materials:** normal monsters drop one 6 % of the time, bosses 1–2, chests 35 % (55 %
  of them enchantment materials, 25 % gems, 17 % element cores, 3 % karma cores). None in the
  tutorial.
- **Daily reward:** follows the `DayReward` table; after its last day it starts over, and a missed
  day starts over at day 1.
- **Looping spawners:** every one in the levels has a loop count of 0, read as "do not repeat".
- **Wandering monsters** rest 2 seconds at each waypoint.
